This version of UNO **doesn't** count cards when someone wins. When someone wins the game its game over.
<br>Score is kept in the User Stats window & house rules are as follows:

 - **Stack +2** - Can negate the +2 and stack it onto the next player and so forth
 - **Keep Drawing** - Keep drawing a card until you can play

Game logs are also created for every game and every move, with the first card and initals cards dealt as the first record.
<br>There is also an option to change profile picture and name.
